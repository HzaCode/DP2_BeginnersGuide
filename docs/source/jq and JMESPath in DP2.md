# jq and JMESPath in DP2

In the DP2 platform, jq and JMESPath are two invaluable tools for processing and parsing JSON data, particularly within the `data out` section. This  guide provides detailed instructions on utilizing these tools in DP2, alongside practical examples to illustrate their application.


### Application of jq in DP2

jq is a lightweight command-line JSON processor that offers a concise way to query, parse, modify, and format JSON data. Here are some common uses of jq:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   Suppose you have a JSON array and you want to extract specific fields from each object, such as `name` and `value`, you can use the following jq expression:

   ```
   .data[] | {name: .name, value: .value}
   ```

   This iterates over the array and creates a new object for each item, containing the `name` and `value` fields.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   If you have a JSON string and want to convert it into a JSON object, you can use the `fromjson` function:

   ```
   . | fromjson
   ```

   This parses the JSON string and returns the corresponding JSON object.

3. **Data Filtering**:
   You can filter data based on specific conditions. For example, to filter all objects where `value` is greater than 80:

   ```
   .data[] | select(.value > 80)
   ```

   This returns all objects that meet the condition.

### Application of JMESPath in DP2

JMESPath is a query language that allows you to extract information from JSON data in a declarative way. Here are some basic uses of JMESPath:

1. **Simple Query**:
   If you want to get all `name` fields from a JSON array, you can use the following JMESPath expression:

   ```
   data[].name
   ```

   This returns an array containing all `name` fields.

2. **Conditional Query**:
   Filter all objects where `value` is greater than 80:

   ```
   data[] | [?value > 80]
   ```

   This returns an array of objects that meet the condition.

3. **Aggregation Query**:
   Perform aggregation operations, such as grouping by `category` and calculating the sum:

   ```
   data[] | group_by(.category) | {category: keys[0], total: sum(.value)}
   ```

   This returns an object containing each `category` and its corresponding sum.

### Combining jq and JMESPath

In some cases, you might need to combine jq and JMESPath for more complex data processing tasks. For example, you could use JMESPath to extract data and then use jq for further processing. Here is an example of combined usage:

Suppose you have a JSON string and you want to extract all objects where `value` is greater than 80, and for each object, add a `discounted_value` field calculated as 80% of `value`. You can do it like this:

1. Use JMESPath to extract data:

   ```json
   {
     "elements": {
       "data": {
         "col": "//script",
         "function": {
           "regexp": "data: (\\\\[\\\\{.+?\\\\}\\\\])",
           "type": "string"
         },
         "data_out": {
           "jq": ".|fromjson"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Use jq to process the extracted data:

   ```json
   {
     "elements": {
       "data": {
         "col": "//script",
         "function": {
           "regexp": "data: (\\\\[\\\\{.+?\\\\}\\\\])",
           "type": "string"
         },
         "data_out": {
           "jq": "fromjson | [?.value > 80] | {name: .name, discounted_value: .value * 0.8}"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

In this process, we first use JMESPath's `parse` feature to extract JSON data, then use jq's query to filter out objects that meet the condition and calculate the discounted value. This way, we can fully utilize the strengths of jq and JMESPath for more flexible data processing.
